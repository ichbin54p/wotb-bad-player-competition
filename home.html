            So, basically, when submitting you must follow certain rules otherwise your scores won't be verified. If you abuse the system, such as posting NSFW, your post will be deleted and if you continue, your account will be suspended.

            How to play:
            <br><br>
            If you encounter a player with bad stats, you can submit them to the website. You need a screenshot of the battle results displaying your team and the opponent team. NOTE: the player which you add can only be in your team and not the opponent team.
            <br><br>
            Once your score is submitted, it will be under review for verification, once verified you can be on the leaderboards. The leaderboards are ranked by "bot score"
            <br><br>
            Bot score is a calculation done between the WR (win rate) and Battle count, just to make things a little more balanced. You can suggest calculation changes by contacting Administators. For example, if your player has a lot of games and a very low WR, you will get a very high bot score.
